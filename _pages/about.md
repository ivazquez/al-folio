I am a Research Fellow in Computational Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering and the Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics at Columbia, working with [Sohrab Shah](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/sohrab-shah) and [Simon Tavar√©](https://tavarelab.cancerdynamics.columbia.edu/). I am interested in studying the mechanisms of spatio-temporal tumor evolution, progression and therapy response. My current research focuses on scalable inference methods and modeling of single-cell genomic and in situ imaging data to study the co-evolution of the tumor and immune ecosystem.
