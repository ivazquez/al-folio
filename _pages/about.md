Our lab is interested in studying the mechanisms of spatio-temporal tumor evolution, progression and therapy response. Our current research focuses on scalable inference methods and modeling of single-cell genomic and in situ imaging data to study the co-evolution of the tumor and immune ecosystem.

We are recruiting! More information about [joining the lab](/join/).
