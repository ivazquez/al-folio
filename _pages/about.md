I am an Assistant Professor at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) and [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/research/about/overview-of-the-research-institute), with an affiliation in the HMS/MGH Departments of Pathology and the MGH Cancer Center. I am also an Associate Member of the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/) as an Associate Member.

Our lab just opened in January 2025. We are interested in studying the mechanisms of spatio-temporal tumor evolution, progression and therapy response. Our current research focuses on scalable inference methods and modeling of single-cell genomic and in situ imaging data to study the co-evolution of the tumor and immune ecosystem.

Interested in joining the team?
* Prospective postdocs / visitors: email me (1) a few sentences on your research interests, (2) your CV, (3) a PDF of your most relevant prior work, and (4) contact information for two or more references.
- [HFSP Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.hfsp.org/funding/postdoctoral-fellowships) (registration deadline mid-August, must be doing PhD outside of the United States)
- [EMBO Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/long-term-fellowships) (deadlines early Feb and early Aug).
- [McDonnell Fellowship](http://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/) (deadline mid-July, note that this fellowship is applied for before choosing a postdoctoral laboratory)

* Prospective PhD students: If you are a current student or have been admitted on a program at HMS, feel free to reach out directly. If you are a prospective PhD student, consider applying to the [HMS Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) PhD Track](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track) or the [Harvard-MIT HST PhD program](https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp). I can also advise students in other programs at Harvard.
* Prospective summer research students: Undergraduates from around the world with exceptionally strong records are invited to apply for a summer research position. We are particularly interested in undergraduates planning on applying to HMS for a PhD. If you are a prospective summer student, consider applying to the [Broad Summer Research Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bsrp/broad-summer-research-program-bsrp).
* Prospective undergraduate students: Talented Harvard/MIT undergraduates interested in spending significant time in the lab are encouraged to email Ignacio a resume and (unofficial) transcript. The laboratory works hard to include exceptional undergraduates in the life of the lab.
