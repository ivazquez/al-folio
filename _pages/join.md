**Interested in joining the team?**

- **Postdocs and staff:** [Email Ignacio](mailto:ivazquez-garcia@mgh.harvard.edu) (1) a few sentences on your research interests, (2) your CV, (3) a PDF of your most relevant prior work, and (4) contact information for two or more references.

- **PhD students:** If you are a current student or have been admitted on a program at HMS, feel free to reach out directly. If you are a prospective PhD student, consider applying to the [HMS Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) PhD Track](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track), the [Harvard-MIT HST PhD program](https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp), or [other programs at Harvard](https://hms.harvard.edu/education-admissions/phd-degree-programs). The lab can also host visiting PhD students interested in collaborative projects on research topics of common interest.

- **Undergraduate students:** Talented undergraduates interested in spending significant time in the lab are encouraged to [email Ignacio](mailto:ivazquez-garcia@mgh.harvard.edu) a resume and (unofficial) transcript. The laboratory works hard to include exceptional undergraduates in the life of the lab.

- **Summer research students:** Undergraduates with exceptionally strong records are invited to apply for a summer research position. We are particularly interested in undergraduates planning on applying to HMS for a PhD. If you are a prospective summer student, consider applying to the [Broad Summer Research Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bsrp/broad-summer-research-program-bsrp) and the [Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center CURE Program](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/cure-overview).

Our lab is committed to diversity and equality, and encourage applications from underrepresented minorities.
