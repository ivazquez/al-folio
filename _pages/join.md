**Interested in joining the team?**

- **Prospective postdocs / visitors:** [Email Ignacio](mailto:ivazquez-garcia@mgh.harvard.edu) (1) a few sentences on your research interests, (2) your CV, (3) a PDF of your most relevant prior work, and (4) contact information for two or more references.

- **Prospective PhD students:** If you are a current student or have been admitted on a program at HMS, feel free to reach out directly. If you are a prospective PhD student, consider applying to the [HMS Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) PhD Track](https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/education/phd-program/big-phd-track) or the [Harvard-MIT HST PhD program](https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp). I can also advise students in [other programs at Harvard](https://hms.harvard.edu/education-admissions/phd-degree-programs).

- **Prospective undergraduate students:** Talented undergraduates interested in spending significant time in the lab are encouraged to [email Ignacio](mailto:ivazquez-garcia@mgh.harvard.edu) a resume and (unofficial) transcript. The laboratory works hard to include exceptional undergraduates in the life of the lab.

- **Prospective summer research students:** Undergraduates with exceptionally strong records are invited to apply for a summer research position. We are particularly interested in undergraduates planning on applying to HMS for a PhD. If you are a prospective summer student, consider applying to the [Broad Summer Research Program](https://www.broadinstitute.org/bsrp/broad-summer-research-program-bsrp) and the [Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center CURE Program](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/research/cancer-disparities/students/cure-overview).
